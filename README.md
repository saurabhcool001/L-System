# L-System
This is a course work 1 for Mathematics for Game and V/AR module.

Asset:
https://github.com/saurabhcool001/LSystem/tree/main/Assets/Scripts
This folder contains all C# scripts which I created for this project to run L-System.

NOTE: Due to the generated project size is bigger than 1.5GB I commited only files which required for project creation.
